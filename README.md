# LoL G2G(Group Together)

## Motivation
Group together was created to be an all in one Team Builder for competitive gaming. We want to eliminate the problem that many users often run into when trying to take the next step in improving their gameplay, struggling to find like minded players or up to date information on builds or strategies. Players should be able to find a team, look for team members, get any news or updates the game has released or that are upcoming. Our goal is to allow players to get any information they need in one place, eliminating the need to use multiple sites to get all the information players need.
